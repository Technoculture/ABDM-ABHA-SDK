> v05_care_contexts_discover_post(authorization, x_hip_id, patient_discovery_request)

Discover patient's accounts

Request for patient care context discover, made by CM for a specific HIP. It is expected that HIP will subsequently return either zero or one patient record with (potentially masked) associated care contexts   1. **At least one of the verified identifier matches**   2. **Name (fuzzy), gender matches**   3. **If YoB was given, age band(+-2) matches**   4. **If unverified identifiers were given, one of them matches**   5. **If more than one patient records would be found after aforementioned steps, then patient who matches most verified and unverified identifiers would be returned.**   6. **If there would be still more than one patients (after ranking) error would be returned**   7. **Intended HIP should be able to resolve and identify results returned in the subsequent link confirmation request via the specified transactionId**   8. **Intended HIP should store the discovery results with transactionId and care contexts discovered for subsequent link initiation**
